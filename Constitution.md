# Smash Up Die Nasty

Smash Up Die Nasty (SUDN) is a themed fantasy football dynasty league. This constitution will be the basis for what will hopefully be a fun and competitive league. The league is designed to run for decades with smooth ownership transitions if necessary. Rules may be modified by league vote to achieve overarching goals. There are not any league dues or fees at this time. The addition or change of league dues will need to be approved by a 3/4 majority (8 votes).

## Expected Owner Conduct

All owners are expected to carry themselves in a respectful manner that would not harm other owners or the league in general. Bragging and "trash talk" is an expected and interesting part of the game, but should be handled in adult fashion. The commissioner / commissioner-committee will draw the line between comments made in good fun and inflammatory comments that could harm the good of the league. Violation of this could result in ejection from the league.

## Activity & Etiquette Rules

Since this is a dynasty league, all owners are expected to be active in some fashion year round. Owners should respond to all trade offers in a timely manner, even if it is just a "no thanks". Nobody likes to be left with no reply, especially if another trade offer is awaiting a reply. This respect should be reciprocated to those receiving offers. If someone says "no", they are "busy", or "not interested in trading" at the time please respect those answers. If an owner is removed from the league for any violation of league rules or by his/her own choice, the commissioner will take charge of that team until a replacement owner is found and approved. The commissioner/co-commissioners will not perform any transactions on behalf of the abandoned team and the lineup will be entered based on optimal ESPN projections.

## Teams

Teams will be named in the style of factions from the SmashUp game. Factions from the core game and select expansions are included as approved name parts. You will take one faction, make it singular as the first part of your team name. The second part of your team name will be another faction. Examples: Princess Mages or Halfling Warriors. Exceptions can be made on a individual basis.

## Schedule

There will be twelve teams in four divisions. The regular season schedule will be 12 weeks long. During the regular season, ties are a possible matchup outcome. Four teams will be selected for the playoffs by the host application, with the playoff seeding tiebreaker decided by total regular season points. The first round of the playoffs will occur during weeks 13-14 of the NFL season. The championship round will occur during weeks 15-16 of the NFL season.

## Roster

Each team will use the following starting positions: 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex (RB/WR), 1 DT, 1 DE, 1 LB, 1 DB (CB/S), 1 K. Beyond the 12 starting positions, each team will have 18 bench slots and 3 injured reserve slots. In a dynasty format, the larger total roster size (30) will support player development, so we will not have a separate rookie squad. Most league rosters will exceed the mandated roster limit at the end of the rookie and free agent draft. Each year, after the rookie and free agent draft, owners will be responsible for trimming their roster to make room for their new draft picks at their discretion. If an owner prefers keeping their existing players over any drafted players, those players will be moved to the free agent pool.

## Drafts

There will be an offline core draft, where teams may select players from the set of players available in the host application. Each owner will have 24 hours to make a selection. Everyone has life responsibilities outside of this league, and should have plenty of time to decide which player to add to their team. Owners are encouraged to create their own player ranking cheat-sheets, and do their own research. Owners can, at their own discretion, communicate regarding the draft in Slack. That includes trading draft picks, helping others, and good natured trash talking. To make a selection during the core draft, notify the commissioner via email, direct Slack message, or in a channel. The commissioner will announce the selection and notify the owner who is on the clock. If an owner fails to make a selection within 24 hours, they will lose the pick in that round and will get a chance to select again at the end of the draft.

Draft positions will be randomized, with at least two owners as witnesses of the random order selection. The picks will be made in a snake fashion, such that the owner with the first pick in the first round will have the last pick in the second round, etc. Owners may trade their entire core draft position with another owner, if desired, after the order is set.

Trading core draft picks, players, and future draft picks is allowed during the draft. Picks for the 2019 rookie draft will be available to be drafted during the core draft. For example, instead of picking a player during a selection of the core draft, an owner may choose to select the next available position in the first rookie draft. Picks for the four-round 2020 rookie draft will be available for trade.

We will hold a draft gathering each year for the rookie and free agent draft. We will attempt to schedule the draft such that the most possible owners can attend. In the event that an owner cannot attend the rookie draft, they can follow the draft and make picks in Slack. If that is not possible, they can assign another trusted person (or owner) to act on their behalf.

## Free Agents

All unselected players will be available for blind bidding using the owner's Free Agent Auction Budget. Each owner will receive 1000 credits in the host application to place bids on available players. Waivers will process every week on Wednesday and Saturday.

## Trades

All trades are final when accepted by both owners and have been executed in the host application. The trade deadline will occur after week 10 of the NFL regular season. Off-season trading is allowed. Off-season trading can begin as early as directly after the real life Super Bowl. If an owner thinks a deal is potentially collusion; he has 48 hours to bring that to the attention of the commissioner. The commissioner will then make a decision regarding the validity of the trade. Owners are encouraged to post on the league Slack in order to explain and discuss any recent trades.

Future draft picks may only be traded for the current and following year, starting with the NFL Super Bowl. So after the Super Bowl in early 2020, you will be able to trade draft picks for the 2021 draft and you would already have access to the picks for the 2020 draft.

All players on the owners roster and rookie picks are available for trade. Rookie picks will be tracked by the commissioner in a shared document online.

## Commissioner

Our goal is to have a fair, balanced league consisting of highly active and competitive owners. The commissioner will act in the best interest of the league at all times. Removing the commissioner is a serious situation and should be considered a last resort. Should the need arise for the commissioner to be removed; 3/4 majority (8 votes) would be required.

If at any time an owner violates league rules or engages in conduct judged by the Commissioner as detrimental to the league in any way, the Commissioner has both the authority and obligation to act to protect the league and to act in its best interests. The Commissioner may impose sanctions against an owner or team found to have violated league rules or conducted themselves in a manner detrimental to the league. All Executive Council members are subject to the same penalties as the rest of the league. It is expected that Commissioner’s use of sanctions will be rare, appropriate to the offense, proportionate to its severity, and not undertaken lightly.

Commissioner's sanctions include but are not limited to the following:

* Public warning
* Retroactive cancellation of trades
* Suspension of waiver rights for a specified period
* Suspension of trading rights for a specified period
* Suspension or benching of players for a specified period
* Suspension of chat room privileges for a specified period
* Suspension of an owner or co-owners for a specified period, with their team forfeiting all games occurring during the suspension
* Forced waiving of players
* Loss of future draft picks
* Loss of Waiver Priority
* Removal of an owner from the league

Any combination of the above sanctions deemed appropriate by the Commissioner.

The Commissioner may impose and enforce sanctions at any time, including retroactively. The Commissioner may use an owner’s past record in considering the length or severity of sanctions.

## Commissioner-Committee

The Commissioners will act in good faith and at all times in the best interest of the league to maintain a fun, fair, competitive environment.

The Commissioner-Committee will have the final authority over all actions, activities, votes, rule changes, and any other thing necessary to effectively run a good league while respecting the rights of its owners. In the rare instance that a situation arises which is not covered by the bylaws, the Commissioner-Committee reserves the right to rule on the issue in the best interest of the league. This includes times when a rule is not explicitly stated (such as a tiebreaker) but must be ruled on to move league business forward. Commissioner rulings are final, binding and cannot be appealed. The intent of this clause is not to grant arbitrary, unchecked Roger Goodell-like power, but rather to empower and require the Commissioners via these bylaws to take fair and necessary executive action for the good of the league.

The role of the Commissioners are to:

* Maintain league logistics
* Help set lineups and perform team / roster moves for owners if requested
* Ensure that the league calendar is updated and followed
* Facilitate drafts
* Apply penalties for owner misconduct, rules violations, or actions against the league as voted on by the Executive Council
* Void trades if rules are clearly violated (tradebacks, roster limits, etc.)
* Control abandoned or otherwise orphaned franchises and seek new ownership

## Rule Changes

Rule changes can be proposed at any time, by anyone. Rule changes will only be voted on during the off-season and must have a majority (7 votes) to pass. Rule change discussions will be discussed during the Pro-Bowl each year.

New rules will be instituted after a year for preparation. So for example, a new rule decided upon during the 2020 offseason will take effect during the 2021-2022 season, and not during the 2020-2021 season.
